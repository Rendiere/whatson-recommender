0,R80 to R95,31 January 2018 to 8 February 2018,8pm,When Swallows Cry,"Baxter Theatre Centre, Main Rd, Rondebosch, Cape Town","Mike van Graan’s When Swallows Cry is a hard-hitting trilogy of playlets that explores the inequities and layered complexities of contemporary global mobility, particularly from African perspectives. Once forced to “migrate” as slaves, Africans are now among the world’s least attractive migrants in the wealthy economies of the world, many built – not insubstantially – on African labour and mineral resources.
The play interweaves three scenarios, set in African or about African migrants and refugees.  Directed by Lesedi Job, the talented cast includes Mbulelo Grootboom, Marty Kintu and Kai Luke Brummer. Norwegian Theatre Company Ibsen International commissioned seven playwrights to create works which tackle the contentious issues of migration and the refugee crisis, and When Swallows Cry is one of the resultant pieces, developed by van Graan alongside playwrights from Europe, China, America and Russia.

Using sculpture, installation and drawing, Wa Lehulere continues his questioning of historical narratives while exploring new formal possibilities. In Here I am, a concrete man, throwing himself into abstraction, taken from a line in his father’s journal, Wa Lehulere expands his visual vocabulary. Wood is deconstructed and singed; metal is reconstituted and glass is weighted as the artists exploits familiar materials to create unexpected objects.
Wa Lehulere recently won the Malcolm McLaren Award presented by Performa for his work I Cut My Skin to Liberate the Splinter. The prize is bestowed in recognition of artists who stage ‘an innovative and thought-provoking performance’ during the New York-based biennial.
A walkabout of the exhibition, with the artist, takes place on Friday 19 January at 10am. Entrance is free and all are welcome.

StateoftheART gallery presents a group exhibition of mixed media works by local artists entitled The Marks we Make. Artists include Liffey Joy, Karla Nixon, Jeannie Kinsler, Jodi Hugo, Shui-Lyn White and more.

Mark making is a term used to describe the different lines, patterns, and textures used to create a piece of art. It applies to any art material on any surface, not only paint on canvas or pencil on paper. A dot made with a pencil, a line created with a pen, a swirl painted with a brush – or paper cutting. These are all types of mark making.

‘The Marks We Make’ brings together StateoftheART artists in an exhibition which explores memory, feelings, folds, layers, stories, and colour.

Cartoons have a long history of impacting society, and this exhibition, showcasing his original works and celebrating him as one of South Africa’s finest cartoonists, is no different.
Bauer became known for his provocative cartoons, mostly portraying the apartheid government, politicians and prominent figures of the time. The materials included in the exhibition span the period from 1985 to 1993. The cartoons provide recollections of SA during the turbulent 1980’s. It also portrays the unbanning of political parties such as the African National Congress (ANC), the release of political prisoners, and captures the negotiations which would eventually result in the country’s first democratic elections.
While theses illustrations reflect a dark time in the country’s history, much of it can still be seen as relevant today. Bauer’s art influenced the early works of Zapiro and Brandon Reynolds, whose cartoons are also presented as a contemporary capsule within the exhibition. These artworks have remained untouched for more than a decade after the artist’s death on 16 December 2001. This poignant tribute documents key moments in SA’s political history, and is geared to encourage contemporary conversations.

In spaces described by decorative foliage or a pink sunrise or sunset, Pratt’s encounter of species delicately reflects an uncertain universe.
Migration is a whimsical look at animals in diaspora. This is not the first time that Pratt has employed animals in her works, but her employment of them remains vested in the juxtaposition of the unexpected, and the absurdity and humour of dreams. Throughout her exhibitions Pratt’s animals have met in curious spaces such as the foreign locales in Away or the sinister cocoon of The Dark Forest. Her works communicate the musings of the artist’s own personal struggles with space and place, and humanity’s tenuous link with the natural world.
“Sarah Pratt has created a collection of elegant-yet-approachable, emotional-yet- lighthearted art which focuses on joy while dealing with a profound issue  – a fitting homage to the life of a faithful friend.” Read Marie Stinnes’ review of Sarah Pratt at Salon 91.

Inspired by author Abraham J Twerski’s book Addictive Thinking, this production is set in a landscape of memory and dreams, and tackles the issues of friendship, dysfunction, addiction and angels. Sara has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder; she is compulsive, alive and hates women who know how to make cupcakes. Andrew, her husband, is on a mission to find a cure for her afflictions and Professor James quietly tries to save Andrew from the inconvenience of his wings.
“The Inconvenience of Wings is a precious, honest, witty, well-informed, raw, pure piece of South African theatre.” Read Thola Antamu’s review of The Inconvenience of Wings.
