The gallery is known for pioneering collectable design in South Africa and has invited a selection of makers to produce exploratory new design work that crosses over into other disciplines, materials and technologies.
Exhibitors include fashion designer Rich Mnisi, ceramic artists Zizipho Poswa and Madoda Fani, sculptors Daniella Mooney and Stanislaw Trzebinski, and newcomers such as 3D illustrator Ferdi B. Dick. Julian McGowan, co-founder of The Guild Group, has provided mentorship and guidance to each designer during the process of creating work for the exhibition and the result is an innovative selection of furniture, lighting, sculpture, jewellery and more.
‘Heavy Metal remains a challenging exhibition. Exploratory design propels the commonplace into the realms of the conceptually complex. At its best, the work at the Foundry is a salient reminder of the astonishing qualities that saturate both raw materials and elements of utility.’ Read Alice Meyer’s review of a previous exhibition at Southern Guild.

The play is inspired by Helen Martins, who lived in Nieu-Bethesda and created the now-famous The Owl House – which is designated a provincial site. The Road to Mecca is the story of a woman’s desire for personal and artistic freedom within the narrow confines of a conservative and highly religious community in the Karoo in early seventies Apartheid South Africa.

‘To present this classic Athol Fugard play at the renowned Fugard Theatre is any director’s dream. Yet, maybe a local equivalent of producing Shakespeare at the Globe, it is also a task accompanied by myriad pressures.’ Read our review of a previous play by Athol Fugard performed at the Fugard Theatre.
