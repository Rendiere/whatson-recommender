The gallery is known for pioneering collectable design in South Africa and has invited a selection of makers to produce exploratory new design work that crosses over into other disciplines, materials and technologies.
Exhibitors include fashion designer Rich Mnisi, ceramic artists Zizipho Poswa and Madoda Fani, sculptors Daniella Mooney and Stanislaw Trzebinski, and newcomers such as 3D illustrator Ferdi B. Dick. Julian McGowan, co-founder of The Guild Group, has provided mentorship and guidance to each designer during the process of creating work for the exhibition and the result is an innovative selection of furniture, lighting, sculpture, jewellery and more.
‘Heavy Metal remains a challenging exhibition. Exploratory design propels the commonplace into the realms of the conceptually complex. At its best, the work at the Foundry is a salient reminder of the astonishing qualities that saturate both raw materials and elements of utility.’ Read Alice Meyer’s review of a previous exhibition at Southern Guild.

David Muller uses the setting of the slopes of Kalk Bay to bring to life two of Heathcote Williams’ poems: Whale Nation and Sacred Elephant.
Muller’s dramatisations of these two epic poems have been described as “haunting” and “entrancing” by critics. The two poems were written by Williams as part of a series that he had hoped to use to bring the plight of the earth to the fore. Both deal with the devastation of the natural environment and the impact humans are having on creatures we are meant to care for.
Guests are invited to enjoy an evening or two in the natural beauty of Kalk Bay, as they are taken on a journey into the ocean with majestic whales or onto the plains with the mighty elephants. Whale Nation is directed by Claire Watling and Sacred Elephant by Stacey Sacks. Guests are encouraged to bring along a picnic and blankets to sit on. A portion of the proceeds go towards the various environmental projects that SAFCEI run in South Africa.

The play interweaves three scenarios, set in African or about African migrants and refugees.  Directed by Lesedi Job, the talented cast includes Mbulelo Grootboom, Marty Kintu and Kai Luke Brummer. Norwegian Theatre Company Ibsen International commissioned seven playwrights to create works which tackle the contentious issues of migration and the refugee crisis, and When Swallows Cry is one of the resultant pieces, developed by van Graan alongside playwrights from Europe, China, America and Russia.

These are all types of mark making.

‘The Marks We Make’ brings together StateoftheART artists in an exhibition which explores memory, feelings, folds, layers, stories, and colour.

Cartoons have a long history of impacting society, and this exhibition, showcasing his original works and celebrating him as one of South Africa’s finest cartoonists, is no different.
Bauer became known for his provocative cartoons, mostly portraying the apartheid government, politicians and prominent figures of the time. The materials included in the exhibition span the period from 1985 to 1993. The cartoons provide recollections of SA during the turbulent 1980’s. It also portrays the unbanning of political parties such as the African National Congress (ANC), the release of political prisoners, and captures the negotiations which would eventually result in the country’s first democratic elections.
While theses illustrations reflect a dark time in the country’s history, much of it can still be seen as relevant today. Bauer’s art influenced the early works of Zapiro and Brandon Reynolds, whose cartoons are also presented as a contemporary capsule within the exhibition. These artworks have remained untouched for more than a decade after the artist’s death on 16 December 2001. This poignant tribute documents key moments in SA’s political history, and is geared to encourage contemporary conversations.
