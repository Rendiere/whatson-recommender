‘Heavy Metal remains a challenging exhibition. Exploratory design propels the commonplace into the realms of the conceptually complex. At its best, the work at the Foundry is a salient reminder of the astonishing qualities that saturate both raw materials and elements of utility.’ Read Alice Meyer’s review of a previous exhibition at Southern Guild.

Cartoons have a long history of impacting society, and this exhibition, showcasing his original works and celebrating him as one of South Africa’s finest cartoonists, is no different.
Bauer became known for his provocative cartoons, mostly portraying the apartheid government, politicians and prominent figures of the time. The materials included in the exhibition span the period from 1985 to 1993. The cartoons provide recollections of SA during the turbulent 1980’s. It also portrays the unbanning of political parties such as the African National Congress (ANC), the release of political prisoners, and captures the negotiations which would eventually result in the country’s first democratic elections.
While theses illustrations reflect a dark time in the country’s history, much of it can still be seen as relevant today. Bauer’s art influenced the early works of Zapiro and Brandon Reynolds, whose cartoons are also presented as a contemporary capsule within the exhibition. These artworks have remained untouched for more than a decade after the artist’s death on 16 December 2001. This poignant tribute documents key moments in SA’s political history, and is geared to encourage contemporary conversations.
