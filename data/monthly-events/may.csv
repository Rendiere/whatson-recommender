Charton explores South Africa’s past by climbing into the shoes of five interwoven characters spanning 200 turbulent years: Mzilikazi, Kruger, Rhodes, Smuts and Mandela.  In a refreshingly human approach to exploring our history, Charton’s account opens one’s eyes to the unique biases and conventional wisdoms which, when layered with an almost Shakespearean sequence of events and influences, combine to make the South African story so unique.
Michael Charton’s approach is based on his belief that South Africa’s past – historically a tool used to inspire fear and hatred and division – can instead be a powerful source of unity and healing. This decade-long project has resulted in a unique product which brings a new clarity to a notoriously complex subject.
